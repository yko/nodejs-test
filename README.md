# **Resurgo.AI Outage Recovery Simulator: Pre-Alpha Demo**
## üöÄ Rebound from any outage, blazingly fast!

---

## **Overview**
üí° Ever faced a production outage? Imagine recovering from it before your team even finishes their first cup of coffee. Welcome to Resurgo.AI's Outage Recovery Simulator ‚Äî an interactive demo showcasing how our AI copilot resolves outages faster than ever.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll experience:
- Simulate outages in a controlled environment.
- Watch *AI-driven Root Cause Analysis (RCA)* solve problems faster than ever.
- Discover how Resurgo.AI revolutionizes incident recovery for modern SaaS teams.

---

## **Why Try This?**
- üöÄ **Discover Cutting-Edge AI**: See Resurgo.AI tackle real-world outage scenarios.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Learning**: Experiment, adapt, and explore outage simulation workflows.
- üåü **Be Part of the Future**: Shape the development of Resurgo.AI by sharing feedback.

---

## **How It Works**
This demo mimics real-world outages, identifies root causes using AI, and delivers recovery insights in GitHub pull requests.
- **Simulate Real-World Outages:** Introduce errors to mimic production failures.
- **Automated RCA by Resurgo.AI:** We use AI and Machine Learning to identify issues, reducing reliance on manual root cause analysis.
- **Get Rapid Insights:** Resurgo.AI provides RCA and recovery recommendations as comments on the GitHub commit that triggered the deployment.

## **Quick Start: Simulate Your First Outage**
Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Fork This Repository**
   [Click here to fork](https://github.com/resurgo-ai/outage-recovery-simulator-nodejs/fork) our demo and create a copy in your GitHub account. ‚ö†Ô∏è Disable the **"Copy the main branch only"** option to access pre-made outage examples ‚ö†Ô∏è.
   - Forking allows you to run and modify the demo independently, preserving the original repository for reference.
   - Disable the **"Copy the main branch only"** option to access pre-made outage examples.

2. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   In *your fork*, navigate to the [Actions](../../actions) tab and enable workflows by clicking:
   `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them.`

3. **Simulate an Outage**
   Merge one of the example branches (e.g., `outage-db-configuration-error`) into the `main` branch to trigger an outage.
   - **Using GitHub Web Interface:** [Create a pull request](../../compare/main...outage-db-configuration-error) to merge `outage-db-configuration-error`.
   - **Using Command Line:**
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_USERNAME}/outage-recovery-simulator-nodejs.git
     cd outage-recovery-simulator-nodejs
     git checkout main && git rebase outage-db-configuration-error && git push
     ```

4. **Observe Automated RCA in Action**
   After pushing to `main`, the workflow will:
   - Simulate a deployment and alert Resurgo.AI.
   - Analyze logs and code changes.
   - Provide Root Cause Analysis and recovery recommendations in a GitHub comment on the latest commit.

4. **Reset the main branch and repeat**
   You can push changes many times and Resurgo.AI will treat each push as a separate deploy. Eventually, you might want to start from scratch or try another example branch, say `outage-sql-syntax-error`. You can always reset the `main` branch to it's original state which marked with the `safe-spot` tag:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard safe-spot
     git push --force origin main
     ```
   Don't worry about using `--force` on a demo app, our workflow will skip force push and will anticipate your next regular push.

5. **Troubleshooting**
    Should you encounter an issue with this demo, please check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/resurgo-ai/outage-recovery-simulator-nodejs/wiki) for troubleshooting tips or create an [issue](https://github.com/resurgo-ai/outage-recovery-simulator-nodejs/issues) in our tracker.

## **Scope of this Demo**
### **üîç Current Focus**
This pre-alpha demo highlights Resurgo.AI's ability to handle **application-level errors** in **self-contained environments**:
- **Self-Inflicted Outages:** Simulates issues caused by code or configuration changes, which account for 60‚Äì80% of SaaS incidents.
- **Software-Level Errors:** Focuses on diagnosing bugs and misconfigurations within application code or database settings.
- **Simplified SaaS Application:** Uses a basic Flask app with user API functionality to prioritize demonstration of outage recovery workflows.

### **üö´ Limitations**
This version is a **proof of concept**, and certain scenarios are out of scope:
- **External Dependencies:** Outages caused by external factors are not currently considered.
- **Deployment Failures:** Failures during build or deploy stages (e.g., infrastructure misconfigurations) are not part of this demo but are planned for future releases.
- **Force Pushes Ignored:** RCA workflows are triggered by normal code pushes. Force pushes, such as branch resets, are intentionally skipped.
- **Workflow and Test File Modifications:** Changes to `.github/workflows/*`, `tests/user.py`, `LICENSE` or this `README.md` will prevent RCA.

---

## **The Bigger Picture**
**Problem:** Outage recovery is slow and stressful. Engineers manually sift through logs, correlate changes, and diagnose issues under pressure. It's costly, time-consuming and cognitively-taxing process.

Resurgo.AI automates this process, delivering actionable insights in minutes after outage detection, often before engineers even start looking at the issue. This offers:
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Faster Recovery:** AI-driven RCA shortens downtime.
- üß† **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Focus on fixing issues, not finding them.
- ü§ù **Improved Team Collaboration:** Share insights seamlessly with stakeholders.
